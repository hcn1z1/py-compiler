# compiler

  Compiler is a tool to compile .py to .exe
  
  used lib: pyinstaller
  
  the important question is
  
# do we really need it?

  no you fucking don't
  
# then why did you make it?
  when you have a stupid && lazy boss
  
  and you don't have windows as an operating system
  
  and you are too lazy to download it and setted it up.
  
  then yeah that's why
  
# would it help me in anything?
  no.
  i just have a stupid boss
  
  who will probably read this
  and will pay-cut me :/ 
  but yeah here i am
  
  *Just use your brain*
  *pip install pyinstaller* &&
  *pyinstaller use_ur_brain*
